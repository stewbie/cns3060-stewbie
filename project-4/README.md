----------------------------------------
First come first serve was the slowest of the 3 since the number of tracks that are traversed really depends on the order that they are entered in by the user. If the user is going to enter them in 'in order' fashion then it could be as optimized as the other algorithms. In most cases though the user will most likely not enter them in 'in order'.
----------------------------------------
Sorted algorithm seems to be the fastest any per the numbers in the outline it is about 3x faster than first come first serve. It seems to be that way because the tracking is designed in a way that we dont double up on many tracks read.
----------------------------------------
Elevator method was the 2nd fastest way that we looked at. Reason it wasn't as fast as the sorted was there was only a few more double read tracks since we are moving up no matter what then back down once we reach the top index that we want to look at.
